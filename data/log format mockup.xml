    Server handling specification
    =============================
    
    The server should look for a broadcast which matches the given time, 
    including a certain error range (like 5 or 10 minutes). If a match
    is found, ask the user whether to extend the existing broadcast and
    add the new transmission (huh, this requires user interaction! need
    a solution. client could ask before and add a broadcast id. server
    may still deny adding a transmission to a broadcast if the timely
    distance is too large)
    Otherwise we add a new broadcast using the given specifications.
    
    Note that only transmissions may be merged, a merge of frequencies
    is *not* allowed. If frequencies mismatch, a new broadcast *must*
    be created (server must enforce this). But the referenced broadcast
    may be used as a template.
    
    Recordings are forwarded by the script to a yet-to-be-specified
    upload interface to the main server, whilist being formatted 
    correctly according to priyom standards. Automatic re-encoding if
    the encoding mismatches may be a possible feature for the future.
